# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-07)

**Core value:** Humans can see exactly what agents are doing and saying to each other in real-time, and intervene naturally at any moment — without breaking the autonomous flow.
**Current focus:** Phase 5 — Chat Injection & State Machines

## Current Position

Phase: 5 of 10 (Chat Injection & State Machines)
Plan: 4 of 4 in current phase
Status: Completed 05-03 agent card ui for state machine guards
Last activity: 2026-03-08 — Distinct agent card controls with force-pause, dual indicator, steer-only resume, and state transition comms events

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Monolith extraction in Phase 1 — must precede all new UI features; workspace_live.ex at 4,714 lines is a hard blocker
- [Roadmap]: TeamBroadcaster intermediary in Phase 2 — prevents LiveView mailbox saturation at 10+ concurrent agents
- [Roadmap]: Pause state and permission-pending state are separate typed state machines from Phase 5 onward — cannot be unified
- [Phase 01]: Wrapped palette render in static outer div to satisfy LiveView stateful component single-static-root requirement
- [Phase 01-monolith-extraction]: forwarded sidebar tab events to parent via send(self(), {:sidebar_event, ...}) to preserve workspace_live inspector_mode side effects
- [Phase 01-02]: component-owned state initialized via assign_new/3 in update/2; parent-forwarded events use send(self(), {:composer_event, event, params})
- [Phase 01]: comms_stream nil-guarded in MissionControlPanelComponent to allow render_component testing without a live process
- [Phase 01-05]: kept budget_pct/1 and budget_bar_color/1 in workspace_live since refresh_roster/1 uses them to compute assigns
- [Phase 01-05]: workspace_live at 3968 lines; remaining code is orchestration (signals, cards, activity) not UI rendering
- [Phase 01-06]: assert component DOM markers (message-input, agent-comms) instead of wrapper ids for reliable liveview test assertions
- [Phase 01-06]: kept existing module compilation smoke tests alongside new live mount test for fast regression catching
- [Phase 02-01]: Topics module uses regular functions (no macros/compile-time constants); global_bus_paths excludes system.**
- [Phase 02-01]: Comms.unsubscribe signature changed from (team_id, agent_name) to (subscription_ids) for explicit lifecycle management
- [Phase 02-02]: Batchable signals grouped into 4 categories (streaming, tools, status, activity) for structured batch delivery
- [Phase 02-02]: Critical signal types defined as MapSet constant for O(1) lookup; direct send/2 delivery matching Jido pattern
- [Phase 02-03]: workspace_live uses send(self(), {:signal, sig}) dispatch from batch handler to reuse existing handle_info clauses; subscribe_global_signals and signal_for_workspace? fully removed
- [Phase 02-04]: removed last two direct Loomkin.Signals.subscribe calls from workspace_live; all signal delivery now exclusively through TeamBroadcaster
- [Phase 03-01]: peer messages classified as critical signals for sub-1-second delivery via TeamBroadcaster
- [Phase 03-01]: stream limit: -500 caps comms events DOM to 500 most recent items
- [Phase 03-01]: blue accent for peer_message type distinct from cyan channel_message
- [Phase 03-live-comms-feed]: CommsFeedScroll uses MutationObserver + scrollTop threshold for reliable LiveView stream patch detection
- [Phase 03-live-comms-feed]: Terminated cards use Process.send_after 3s delay before removal to allow fade animation
- [Phase 04-01]: AgentWatcher uses Process.send_after polling (500ms x 5 attempts) for recovery detection rather than registry event hooks
- [Phase 04-01]: Crash count tracked per {team_id, agent_name} key across watcher lifetime for monotonic increment
- [Phase 04-01]: Agent :DOWN handler sets :error on abnormal exits, :idle on normal/shutdown
- [Phase 04]: Used tasks_override/deps_override assigns for component testing without DB queries
- [Phase 04-03]: Reuse card-error class for all crash states (crashed, recovering, permanently_failed)
- [Phase 04-03]: 2-second Process.send_after delay for recovering->idle transition
- [Phase 05]: test stubs already existed on branch from prior work; verified correctness rather than recreating
- [Phase 05-01]: pause_queued field separate from pause_requested to avoid conflating two distinct mechanisms
- [Phase 05-01]: broadcast_team for pause_queued reuses Agent.Status signal with :pause_queued atom status
- [Phase 05-02]: inject_broadcast delegates to send_message for non-paused agents instead of checking status externally
- [Phase 05-02]: broadcast_mode defaults to true in team sessions, false in solo -- reset only on explicit agent selection
- [Phase 05]: resume button removed in favor of steer-only flow requiring mandatory guidance text
- [Phase 05]: set_status_and_broadcast extended to 4-tuple signal with metadata map for backwards compatibility
- [Phase 05-04]: broadcast_mode defaults to params["team_id"] != nil in mount; also set explicitly to true in start_and_subscribe team_id branch
- [Phase 05-04]: source inspection tests used for force_pause and broadcast send paths that require live Agent processes
- [Phase 05-04]: assert_received used to verify self-send {:steer_agent} dispatch from resume_agent handler in unit tests
- [Phase 06]: approval_pending dot class target is bg-violet-500 animate-pulse (not amber); agent card wrapper class is agent-card-approval (not agent-card-blocked)
- [Phase 06]: approval signal types agent.approval.requested and agent.approval.resolved classified as critical in TeamBroadcaster
- [Phase 06]: approval gate tool blocks only the tool task process, not the agent GenServer, mirroring AskUser pattern
- [Phase 06]: Resolved signal published on all three outcomes (approved/denied/timeout) so LiveView always receives gate close notification
- [Phase 06]: approve handler clears leader_approval_pending only via deny — resolved signal clears it on the signal path
- [Phase 06]: pending_approval cleared in both handle_event AND handle_info resolved to cover timeout path
- [Phase 06]: approval panel appended below main card content area, not an absolute overlay — consistent with permission hook pattern
- [Phase 06]: deadline_at computed in template as started_at + timeout_ms so JS hook reads a single data attribute
- [Phase 06]: JS.toggle used for Approve w/ Context and Deny textarea expansion — no round-trip to server required
- [Phase 06-approval-gates]: leader_approval_pending passed as named assign to MissionControlPanelComponent; banner before concierge section; countdown timer id scoped to gate_id to avoid hook id collisions
- [Phase 07-confidence-triggers]: Commented out unused aliases in stubs rather than omitting — documents Wave 1 intent without compiler warnings
- [Phase 07-confidence-triggers]: Wave 0 stub pattern: @moduletag :skip + assert false placeholder; @tag :skip on each test for per-test readability
- [Phase 07-02]: Used cond instead of multi-clause guards because System.monotonic_time/1 cannot be used in Elixir guard expressions
- [Phase 07-02]: self() in build_loop_opts/1 correctly captures Agent GenServer pid since function is called from GenServer process context
- [Phase 07-confidence-triggers]: pending_questions list replaces pending_question singular map in agent card assigns to support batching AskUser questions
- [Phase 07-confidence-triggers]: Absolute overlay removed; cyan panel appended below card content area — consistent with Phase 06 approval gate appended panel pattern
- [Phase 07-confidence-triggers]: Google auth test failures are pre-existing env issues (real credentials in dev env) — out-of-scope for Phase 7
- [Phase 07-04]: Human visually confirmed all confidence trigger ui behaviors: cyan pulsing dot, batched ask_user panel, let_team_decide resolution, and rate-limit drop — Phase 7 complete
- [Phase 08-01]: Wave 0 pattern reused exactly as established in Phase 5 and Phase 7 — @moduletag :skip at module level skips all tests in the file
- [Phase 08-02]: ChildTeamCreated published from Manager.create_sub_team/3 after start_nervous_system, not from TeamSpawn tool — Manager is single canonical source
- [Phase 08-02]: team.child.created added to @critical_types MapSet for O(1) lookup and instant delivery bypassing 50ms batch window
- [Phase 08-03]: agent_pid = self() moved to top of on_tool_execute closure so both AskUser and TeamSpawn paths share it without redundant self() calls
- [Phase 08-03]: terminate/2 uses try/catch :exit for Manager.dissolve_team; spawned_child_teams not restored on OTP restart — agent boots with [] and re-accumulates
- [Phase 08-04]: handle_info :child_team_created arity changed to 4-tuple; signal handler extracts parent_team_id and team_name from sig.data
- [Phase 08-04]: team_names starts empty on reconnect path — repopulates on next ChildTeamCreated signal; Plan 05 falls back to short_id/1 when name absent
- [Phase 08-dynamic-tree-visibility]: TeamTreeComponent hidden via :if={@team_tree != %{}} — zero DOM output when no sub-teams; compute_agent_counts/1 derives counts from roster at render time without extra assign; human-approved visual verification 2026-03-08
- [Phase 09-spawn-safety]: wave 0 stub pattern reused from phases 7/8 — @moduletag :skip at module level, @tag :skip per test, flunk placeholder
- [Phase 09-spawn-safety]: spawn gate signal types agent.spawn.gate.requested and agent.spawn.gate.resolved classified as critical in TeamBroadcaster (Plan 02 implements)
- [Phase 09-spawn-safety]: spawn gate intercept runs in tool task (on_tool_execute closure), not in GenServer — same pattern as RequestApproval.run/2
- [Phase 09-spawn-safety]: open_spawn_gate is a cast (not call) to avoid deadlock: tool task sends cast then blocks on receive
- [Phase 09-spawn-safety]: execute_spawn_and_notify passes gate_id=nil for auto-approve path to skip GateResolved publish (no gate opened)
- [Phase 09-spawn-safety]: approve_spawn uses gate_id param key (not gate-id with dash) matching plan spec
- [Phase 09-spawn-safety]: toggle_auto_approve_spawns uses find_agent_pid with nil team_id falling back to cached_agents lookup
- [Phase 09-spawn-safety]: spawn gate panel uses identical violet accent and structural layout as checkpoint panel — same card pattern, different content block; format_roles/1 handles atom and string keyed role maps; human visually confirmed end-to-end flow 2026-03-08

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- workspace_live.ex at 3,968 lines after Phase 1 extraction (down from 4,714) — further reduction requires extracting signal dispatch (Phase 2 TeamBroadcaster)
- Permission state machine bug FIXED in 05-01 (pending_permission can no longer be overwritten by pause requests)
- LLM confidence extraction format for Phase 7 is a design decision not yet made — needs product decision during Phase 7 planning
- Approval gate timeout UX for Phase 6 needs explicit decision: auto-deny vs. escalate — needs product decision during Phase 6 planning
