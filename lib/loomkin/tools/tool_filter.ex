defmodule Loomkin.Tools.ToolFilter do
  @moduledoc """
  Role-specific tool filtering.

  Categorizes tools and restricts which tools each role can access,
  structurally preventing agents from performing wrong-role work.
  For example, researchers cannot write files, and coders cannot
  spawn sub-agents for investigation.

  The filter is applied at two levels:
  1. **Declaration** — `tools_for_role/1` returns the canonical tool list for a role
  2. **Runtime** — `allowed?/2` validates a tool module against a role at execution time

  Tool categories:
  - `:read` — file reading and search (FileRead, FileSearch, ContentSearch, DirectoryList)
  - `:write` — file mutation (FileWrite, FileEdit)
  - `:exec` — command execution (Shell, Git)
  - `:decision` — decision graph tools (DecisionLog, DecisionQuery, PivotDecision, GenerateWriteup)
  - `:peer` — peer communication and context mesh tools
  - `:lead` — team management tools (TeamSpawn, TeamAssign, etc.)
  - `:coordination` — team observation tools (TeamProgress, TeamComms)
  - `:consensus` — collective decision-making (CollectiveDecision)
  - `:cross_team` — cross-team communication (CrossTeamQuery, ListTeams)
  - `:investigation` — autonomous investigation tools (SubAgent, LspDiagnostics)
  - `:graph_merge` — decision graph merging (MergeGraph)
